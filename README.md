## About an Imagine or Reality :)

Hakuna Matata = **a path without worries.**

“Everything you can imagine is real.”- We are a community based on a project to harmonize thoughts and reality.

## _We are here for the weak, we are for us._

In literature, Thomas Reid wrote the Intellectual Powers of Man in 1786 that the strength of a logical chain is determined by its weakest link. 
In one of Lenin's articles, published in the journal Pravda in 1917 which was very influential in changing the face of Russia in terms of seeing the world.
"Ignoring the weakest people in a country will only bring a strong nation even to the point of being as weak as the weakest."

In simple terms, this theory explains that the _strength of a chain lies in its weakest link_. In looking at the world, we think that the bottom line is a weak point. There is no strong path without weak points, if we want to be strong, then know our weak points.

On this earth, we are all looking for a way. Search for answers and create questions. But sometimes we have to think differently, act differently, and live differently. Sometimes we have to do it our way, what we have to do. Sometimes we have to make the path ourselves, answer it ourselves, and work things out ourselves. There are many things in life that we should go through on our own.

**_If there are many answers, take the shortest answer_**. - Ockham's razor principle.
